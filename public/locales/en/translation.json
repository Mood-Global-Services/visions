Ballard's novel The Crystal World (1966), which describes a reality in which nature crystallizes, dissolving the differences between living beings and objects. This metaphor guides the reflection on contemporary transformations in which traditional boundaries are blurring: between human and non-human, real and digital, aesthetic and economic. Foresta di Cristallo explores, through the works on display, the dematerialization of value and the redefinition of meaning in a world in which art, technology, and digital economies intertwine in new forms of relationship and mutation.",
